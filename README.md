A Python script to extract sentences with and audio and their translations from [50Languages](https://www.50languages.com/)
and generate [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcards from them for language learning.

## Usage

- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the script using something like: `python fiftylangs2anki.py --srclang en --destlang tr --start 5 --end 10`
- You should see a deck package named `50Languages_en-tr_5-10.apkg` in the current working directory.

The `--srclang` and `--destlang` flags take codes of two languages. These are languages you choose in 50Languages's interface
and are shown in the URL of each lesson.

The `--start` and `--end` flags specify the range of lessons to download. By default,
all lessons will be downloaded (from 1 to 100).

The generated Anki notes use a notetype consisting of front-back and back-front card types.
More options to customize this may be added in the future.

All materials downloaded from 50Languages are cached under the `cache` directory for re-use in subsequent
invokations of the script that involve the same source or destination language.

## AnkiWeb decks

I plan to upload some decks generated by the script to [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/).
